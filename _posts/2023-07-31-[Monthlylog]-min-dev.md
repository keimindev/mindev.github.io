# 📝 What I learned 
I feel like I've spent a month without focusing on anything and haven't achieved much. 
Would it be okay to use the excuse of the vacation season to explain my distracted state? 

Driven by the desire to broaden my skillset, I became ambitious about 'English' and decided to create a Github Pages(this one :)) dedicated solely to 'English' as a portfolio.
Although i worked on various aspects, I've only managed to upload two pieces of content in English. <b> The swift and decisive action was great, but I'm disappointed with the lack of consistency. </b>

### 💻 At Work
#### 🌱 Finally re-build TEAM again
The development team, as well as other teams, has welcomed new talents, and everyone is gradually adapting and working towards normalizing operations. I, too, find myself in a situation where I need to align with the backend developers, and I've received fundamental questions like, "Why do you exchange data in such that form?" It's been a great opportunity for me as a frontend developer to explore and consider alternative approaches beyond the familiar methods I was used to before.  



#### 🌙 1 Year and 2 Months As a Frontend Developer
I'm still a fledgling. I thought I could handle many aspects in web front development after a year. Since I frequently deal with file and image data in my work, I might become somewhat of an expert in this area. not really though. I couldn't find a clear answer. These moments have accumulated, leading me to a time of self-reflection, wondering if these experiences has shaped my entire year. It made me question if I had understand that backend part to some extent, would I have encountered such situations? My thoughts are entangled in a web of contemplation.

<br>
I've become a legacy of the company after working here for 1 year and 2 months. The product manager has disappeared, and there's no one in the operations team who understands product planning. It's really frustrating. People expect me to know everything... Argh! Anyway, the new Product Owner (PO) has been busy, shuttling between the development team, trying to piece together fragments of the product's keywords from developers who have been here for over a year. I feel both sorry and at the same time, <b>it made me deeply contemplate the importance of documentation and how to manage it effectively.</b>

### 👩🏻‍💼Personal
- [freeCamp_frontEnd Development_Curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/)
  - When I decided to take on this frontend curriculum, my main motivation was to obtain a certification to add to my LinkedIn profile. Although I am familiar with using various frontend framework and libraries, I have yet to complete half of the curriculum. Specifically, I'm not accustomed to working Class-based programming in React, which is required for certain parts of the curriculum. The goal is to add the certification to my LinkedIn by early August.
