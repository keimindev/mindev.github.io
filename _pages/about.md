<h4>About me 👩🏻‍💻</h4>
<p>My name is Keira Jeong. I am currently working as a front-end developer in Seoul, South Korea. I strive to think deeply and embrace diverse perspectives, not only in web development but also in app development. I am currently focusing on React.js with TypeScript and Next.js, and I also have experience with Flutter.</p>
<p>I have a passion for traveling and enjoy maintaining an active lifestyle through fitness and swimming. I also like to express my daily life through diary-style illustrations on Instagram and indulge in various hobbies.</p>
